<b>Inter Process Communication Library V1.0</b><br /><br />
The <b>DiscretePID</b> model contains the discretized PID controller with the step signal with 20 amplitude and 5s start time as a reference signal. The measured speed of the DC motor is read from the shared memory and given to the feedback of the discrete PID controller. Based on the difference between setpoint and measured speed, the discrete PID controller provides a control signal, which is written into the shared memory.
</p>

<p>
The values of control signal and speed of the DC motor are written into and read from the shared memory at sampling interval of 0.05 seconds respectively. <a href=\"modelica://InterProcessCommunication.SharedMemory_Functions.SharedMemoryRead\"> SharedMemoryRead </a> and <a href=\"modelica://InterProcessCommunication.SharedMemory.SharedMemoryWrite\"> SharedMemoryWrite </a> functions are used to read the speed of the DC motor from the shared memory and write the control signal into the shared memory respectively. The pidOutputIndex and pidInputIndex variables serve as index of the tag i.e. pidOutputIndex points to the value of control signal and pidInputIndex points to the value of speed of the DC motor. The value of the speed of the DC motor, returned by the <a href=\"modelica://InterProcessCommunication.SharedMemory.SharedMemoryRead\"> SharedMemoryRead </a> function is stored in the pidIutputValue variable. The value of the pidIutputValue is in turn assigned to the filter1.u variable, which serves as an input to the feedback of the discrete PID controller. Similarly, the value of control signal is  assigned to pidOutputvalue variable. Therefore, the value of the pidOutputvalue is written into shared memory using <a href=\"modelica://InterProcessCommunication.SharedMemory.SharedMemoryWrite\"> SharedMemoryWrite </a> function.
